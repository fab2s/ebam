# Platonic approach

### Why 42 rules ?

> That is not THE question

### Is there anything I should learn ?

> You mostly need to un-learn

### Am I fit to innovation ?

> If you can "not do it", just don't

### Why would you say such a thing, why is it useful to the matter ?

> You ask me why when I show you how

### That's kind of harsh ...

> Stop winning, this is actually kind

### Now you are playing with me ...

> Playing is a very serious matter

### Like having fun, fooling around and joking ?

> Exactly

### Ahahaha ...

> This is genuinely serious, be a child, don't be childish

### A bit too simple hey ?

> Simplicity is what comes last, it is the very essence of true complexity

### What ?

> Complex thing can only be ruled by simple principles, it would just be too complex otherwise

### How can this be of any use ?

> Doers don't ask, they just do

### No kidding, I need shit to get done, not a philosophical lecture

> That's what I said, you need to be a doer

### I was going to say that this is a bit too simple ...

> Good thing you did not, because simple is not stupid

### But my boss, my investors, what about them ?

> They need to learn not to be in charge, making money should suffice

### I was about to laugh ...

> We are indeed getting somewhere

### Seriously though, deadlines, customers, how do you handle that ?

> When you go slower, it's easier to tell when you will arrive, but do you really want to go slower ?

### Faster ?

> Doers go faster when they just do. So yes, when you do, you may follow some mid / long term paths that are not immediately felt by managers and customers, but at the end of the day, you go faster by a lot, especially if you actually go toward a solution

### But this is not practical !

> In practice, what this means is that, yes, you will lose the exactly on tuesday delivery, but should this occur, it would only be postponed until next week, and if it is not, then it means that no deadline was achievable

### What do I win by letting that happen ?

> From experience your yearly throughput will be at least increased by ten time if you just encourage doers to do.

### Ten time, really, now you are exaggerating !

> This is actually a low estimate. Don't you see projects leading nowhere ? Don't you see product delivered that no one ever use or even wanted ? 

### Yeah right, more often than not, but this is not my fault

> If you can excuse yourself, you should be able to wait until next week

### No one will believe that, it's too simplistic

> Complexity is a singularity of simplicity, not the other way around

### You're escaping the topic, where are my ten times ?

> At the bottom really. Because when you cut all the BS, there is really a lot of room for doers to do

### I want numbers

> No you don't, you want results, you want actually useful products, you want them to work and to solve real problems. This is how you win. It is not possible to be efficient when the people in charge of defining a problem are not the one solving it

### But I need numbers

> Do not confuse between marketing and product. Do not intoxicate yourself with the message you are trying to sell. A product is real, just like value and income, which are the only two numbers you should care about

### Ho I see now, you are just a frustrated engineer wanting to prove something and get more power

> I'm not an engineer, I am a thinker

### Yeah right, just one more geek that knows it all and wants to decide ...

> Truth is, doers don't need decision, doers need information, doers need actual knowledge of the real situation. There is no way around it, doers will make choices, and it is on you if you intoxicated them to a point where they only take the bad ones. In practice decisions belongs to the community, not the individual

### Oh, horizontal management, this is not new ...

> Nothing is new, we are not inventing brains here

### That was easy ...

> You cannot imagine how badly a scientist needs a designer, how badly a technician needs a marketer, how badly an organisation needs administrators, how badly every skill is needed in every company. Who built walls in the first place ? Doers ? I don't think so

### Wait, are you saying that managers are useless ?

> Quite the opposite, we just need you for what you do, not for anything else. And by doing, I don't necessarily mean baking concrete. Thinking is doing, being kind is doing, owning your shit is doing

### What's not then ?

> Not doing is essentially not owning your shit. That is to unload your own insecurity on people around you, that is pretending instead of being, that is making it impossible for doers to do

### My investor just yielded at me for the whole weekend, do you find it easy ?

> It is truly not, but this is your shit, own it, turn it into more doing, more do-ability, and those conversations will end up by themselves. The greater mistake would be to destroy instead of create

### Okay, but what can I do then ?

> Be epic

### How ?

> By all means

### What does it mean ?

> Epic Win, Epic Loose. Anything in between is just pure loss of time
